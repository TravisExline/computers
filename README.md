Deliverables for next review

Refactoring:

*  Brand class
    Create a find_or_create_by class method
    Create a find_by_index class method

*  cli.rb - lines 32-34
    Can we find a brand based on user input, save it to a variable, and then call an instance method on that brand to get us back its computers?

* cli.rb - line 40
    Allow a user to see more information about a particular computer from the Brand options, and create the necessary logic to allow a user to return to all computers, brands, exit, etc.
